# Restaurant Management System - Testing Guide

## Installation

Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Testing Scripts

### 1. Automated Endpoint Test
```bash
python3 quick_test.py
```
This tests basic endpoint availability and responses.

### 2. Comprehensive E2E Test (when server is stopped)
```bash
python3 test_app.py
```
This performs full database testing but requires the Flask server to be stopped first to avoid database locks.

### Test Scenario: Complete Order Flow with Stock Management

#### Step 1: Create Menu Items
1. Go to **Menu** (Men√∫)
2. Click **Agregar Nuevo Art√≠culo**
3. Create **Stockable Item**:
   - Name: `Pizza Margarita`
   - Description: `Pizza with tomato and cheese`
   - Category: `Comida`
   - Price: `15.99`
   - ‚úÖ **Check "Controlar Stock"**
   - Click **Agregar Art√≠culo**

4. Create **Non-Stockable Item**:
   - Name: `Mesa Service` 
   - Description: `Table service charge`
   - Category: `Comida`
   - Price: `5.00`
   - ‚ùå **Leave "Controlar Stock" unchecked**
   - Click **Agregar Art√≠culo**

**Expected:** Both items appear in the menu list.

#### Step 2: Add Stock to Stockable Item
1. Go to **Movimientos de Stock**
2. Click **Agregar Movimiento**
3. Fill form:
   - Art√≠culo: `Pizza Margarita`
   - Cambio de Stock: `+25` (positive number to add stock)
   - Notas: `Initial inventory`

**Expected:** 
- Movement appears in history
- Stock shows as 25 for Pizza Margarita on Dashboard

#### Step 3: Create Table

2. Click **Agregar Mesa**
3. Fill form:
   - N√∫mero de Mesa: `10`
   - Capacidad: `4`
4. Click **Agregar Mesa**

#### Step 4: Create Order
1. From **Mesas**, click **Nueva Orden** on Table 10
2. Enter customer name: `Test Customer`
3. Click **Iniciar Orden**

**Expected:** Redirected to order detail page showing empty order.

1. In **Agregar Art√≠culo a la Orden** form:
   - Select `Pizza Margarita`
   - Quantity: `3`
   - Notes: `Extra cheese`
   - Click **Agregar Art√≠culo**

2. Add second item:
   - Select `Mesa Service`
   - Quantity: `1`
   - Notes: `Premium service`
   - Click **Agregar Art√≠culo**

**Expected:** 
- Order shows both items with correct quantities and prices
- Total calculates correctly: (3 √ó $15.99) + (1 √ó $5.00) = $52.97
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stock should NOT change yet** - check Dashboard shows Pizza still at 25

#### Step 6: Test Order Editing (New Feature)
1. Change Pizza quantity from 3 to 2 by editing the quantity field
2. Edit notes for Mesa Service by changing text and clicking üíæ
3. Try removing an item using the üóëÔ∏è button

2. Confirm in dialog

**Expected:**
- Order status changes to "closed"
- Redirected to orders list showing closed order

#### Step 8: Verify Stock Was Updated
1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Check Pizza Margarita stock level

**Expected:** 
- Pizza stock should now be 23 (25 - 2, if you edited to 2 pizzas)
- Non-stockable item (Mesa Service) should have no stock tracking

#### Step 9: Verify Stock Movement History
1. Go to **Movimientos de Stock**
2. Look for automatic movement

**Expected:**
- New movement entry: `Auto: Order #[ORDER_ID] closed - Pizza Margarita x2`
- Movement type: `Out`
- Quantity change: `-2`
- Running stock shows progression: 25 ‚Üí 23

#### Step 10: Verify Order History

## Database Verification (Optional)

If you want to check the database directly:

```bash
sqlite3 app/inventory.db

-- Check order item history
SELECT * FROM order_item_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check stock movements
SELECT * FROM movements ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check order status
SELECT o.*, rt.table_number FROM orders o 
JOIN restaurant_tables rt ON o.table_id = rt.id 
ORDER BY o.id DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## Troubleshooting

- **500 Errors**: Usually database locks. Stop server, restart, try again.
- **Items not appearing**: Check that forms submitted successfully (look for validation errors).
- **Stock not updating**: Ensure order is **closed** - stock only updates on order completion.
- **Edit buttons missing**: Only active orders can be edited, closed orders are read-only.
